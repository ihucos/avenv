# avenv
A more isolated virtualenv

## Install / Update
```
curl --fail --location https://github.com/ihucos/avenv/raw/master/avenv-dist.tar | tar -xf - -C /usr/local/bin/
```

### How to use
Just exactly like virtualenv (but it's called `avenv`)

### What is this ?
It's basically a lightweight replacement for containers in the interface of `virtualenv`, so you don't need to learn new stuff.

### Why should I use it?
More isolation. You don't even need to have python installed.

### Linux only support
Tell your employer to stop using Macintosh

### No Python 2 support
Life is no pony-ranage. It's over, no Python 2 support.
